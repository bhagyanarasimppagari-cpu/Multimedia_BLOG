      film starring Yash as the ruthless gangster Rocky, who solidifies his
      control over the Kolar Gold Fields (KGF) but faces new formidable enemies,

      Tandon), leading to bloodier battles for supremacy as the government

      intense confrontations and a dramatic climax as he battles internal
      betrayals and external forces.
